# ArduinoWeatherStation
### Open source weather station code and hardware for foot launched flight (FLF)

## Assumptions: 
- You have a bash style shell 
-- Linux: terminal
-- Windows: [GitBash for Windows | https://gitforwindows.org/ ]
- There is a root folder that you use for for development
-- referred to as $DEV_HOME
-- I use ~/Development (or C:\Development)


## Software Requirements

- Development tools Setup
-- [Arduino IDE | https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software]

## Hardware Requirements
-- Arduino Mega
-- Brain board (TODO: needs circuit diagram and parts list etc) 

## Get and Build Software

-- Clone this repo (and submodules)

`
git clone --recursive https://github.com/crestlinesoaring/ArduinoWeatherStation.git
`



## Installation

## Testing (Bench) 

## Forks/Contributions
The goal is to build a robust and readily reproduced weather station for FLF oriented micro-meterology. Forks, contributions, issue reports and constructive feedback are welcome. 
Please contact: [Project Coordinator] for more informtaion on contributing source code.
